# IntelliJ IDEA New UI Theme

Tried to emulate IntelliJ new gen theme (light). The aim is to achieve similar look and feel as IntelliJ IDEA along with keeping distractions to a minimum. 



_Work in progress. Expect updates._

Token highlighting based on [IDEA like light Theme](https://github.com/karsany/vscode-ideal-theme) which I believe had the most accurate resemblance to IntelliJ.

_Please note that I work primarily on JAVA, and thereby this theme is mostly tested on JAVA and general usage. Support for other languages are not tested as accurately. Feel free to provide feedback and I'll try to act upon them._

**Enjoy!**
